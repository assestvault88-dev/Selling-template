## 8. 🚫 NO REFUND POLICY

**Due to the nature of digital products, specifically templates, which are immediately accessible and non-returnable upon purchase, we strictly adhere to a No Refund Policy.**

### All Sales Are Final

- By purchasing this template, you agree that **all purchases are non-refundable and non-exchangeable**.
- Once the template file (or access link) has been delivered/downloaded, the sale is considered **final**.
- No refunds will be issued under any circumstances after download.

### Why We Don't Offer Refunds

1. **Irrevocable Digital Access**: The moment you download or gain access to the template, you have the full value of the product. Unlike physical goods, digital products cannot be "returned" in a state where they cannot be used.

2. **Preventing Abuse**: This policy protects intellectual property and prevents potential abuse where templates could be purchased, downloaded, and then refunded.

3. **Instant Delivery**: Digital products are delivered instantly upon purchase, making it impossible to verify non-use.

### Limited Exceptions

We may consider assistance (not refunds) ONLY in these rare cases:

- **Technical Errors**: If there is a documented and verifiable technical issue (e.g., corrupted file, broken download link) that we are unable to fix within a reasonable timeframe. This does NOT cover:
  - Compatibility issues with your specific software
  - User error or lack of technical knowledge
  - Changing your mind after purchase

- **Duplicate Purchase**: If you accidentally purchase the exact same template twice, we will refund the duplicate purchase if you notify us within 24 hours.

### Customer Responsibility

**BEFORE PURCHASING, you must:**

1. Read the full product description
2. Review the demo/preview
3. Confirm the template meets your needs
4. Verify compatibility with your intended use
5. Understand that this is a digital product with no refunds

- You have read and understood this No Refund Policy
- You waive any right to a refund, chargeback, or dispute
- All sales are final and binding

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: Initiating a chargeback or payment dispute after downloading the template is a violation of this license and may result in legal action.
